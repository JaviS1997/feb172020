# These are the exercises we did today in class.

## Here are the extra requirements:
1. In the triangle problem: calculate and print the area of the traiangle
2. In the one with the doubled letters: check again if all the letters are tripled. Ex: aaabbbcccdddEEE
3. In the one with max 4 numbers: change it to read the number of numbers first and then read all the numbers and print the max.
4. In the one with recursive even numbers, change it to calculate n! recursively. 
Remember that 4! = 1x2x3x4 and n! = (n-1)! x n and that 0! = 1
